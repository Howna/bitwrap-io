WIP
---

* ACL on schema creation / all RPC commands

BACKLOG
-------

* consider if we need to refactor github auth to make it optional
  * use case is: I want to host an API server to just use JWT bearer tokens

* add a way to change schemata names when uploading as xml

ICEBOX
-------

* fork to create gitwrap.com - hosted editing and testing of petri-nets

  * enforce Auth via rest API & socketio connections
  * allow user-created schemata - ( saved in db or s3 )
  * add feature to save petri-net designs
  * require auth to save (on s3? / filesystem)
  * no guarenteed db storage (maybe publish events to s3 bucket)
  * allow end users to bind listeners to specific schema/oid combos
  * POC feature to save petri-net designs (no auth)

* perhaps change cursor style for various objects when editor changes modes

* remove all other string substitions
